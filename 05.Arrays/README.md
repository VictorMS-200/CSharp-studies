## Topics

In this project, I apply the knowledge of the following things: How to use an Array, a List, the difference between them and generics.

Projects of the section [05. Arrays] of the repository:
- Array Size (Show the size of an array)
- Search Word (Search a word in an array)
- Median (Median of the numbers in an array)
- Equal Numbers (Show the equal numbers in an array)
- Account List (Add, remove, change and show accounts in a list with the bank system)

## How to use it?

First of all, you need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0">here</a>. After that, you can clone this repository and run the projects in your IDE. I recommend using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Community.
If you want to do this in Visual Studio Code, you can use the extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp">C#</a> to run the projects.

After cloning the repository, you can already run the projects. And for that, you need to write the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dotnet run --project (Folder of the project you want to run)
```

For example, if you want to run the project "01.HelloWorld", you need to cd into the folder "01.FirstSteps/01.HelloWorld" and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run --project (.\01.FirstSteps\01.HelloWorld\)
```

Tip: You can use the key TAB to autocomplete the folder name in the terminal.
