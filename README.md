In this repository, there are all the exercises and tests of new learning along my journey absorbing knowledge in the C # programming language.

## Topics

Above, there are the C # language fundamentals projects. 

- 01. First steps: Simple projects, but that are fundamental for a journey to learn a new language.
- 02. Object Orientation: Creating classes and objects. 
- 03. Inheritance and interface: Inheriting one class to another class and implementing an interface in a class.
- 04. Exceptions: Projects that contain exception handling and creation.
- 05. Arrays: Projects that contain arrays and lists.
- 06. Files: Creating, reading, writing, and deleting files.
- 07. API: Consuming an API.

## Why?

This repository aims to record my learning and evolution in the C # language. And also, to help other people who are starting to learn this language. For this, I will try to be as didactic as possible in the explanations of the codes. For more information, contact me in my [Linkedin]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-martins-3565a4268/")

## How to use?

First of all you need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it [here]("https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0"). After that, you can clone this repository and run the projects in your IDE. I recommend using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Community. After cloning the repository, you can run the projects using the following command in the terminal (inside the project folder):

```bash
dotnet run
