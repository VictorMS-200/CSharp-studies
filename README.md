- 01. First steps: Simple projects, but that are fundamental for a journey to learn a new language.
- 02. Object Orientation: Creating classes and objects.

## Why?

This repository aims to record my learning and evolution in the C # language. And also, to help other people who are starting to learn this language. For this, I will try to be as didactic as possible in the explanations of the codes. For more information, contact me in my [Linkedin]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/victor-martins-3565a4268/")
